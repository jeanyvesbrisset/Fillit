# Fillit

42 Project

The goal of this program is to take several tetrominoes and to arrange them in the most optimized way, in order to take less space as possible.
A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally. A popular use of tetrominoes is in the video game Tetris, which refers to them as tetriminos.

The program cannot leak. All errors must be handled carefully. In no way can the program quit in an unexpected manner (Segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc).

To compile, run 'make'. This will compile fillit. Execute with a fillit map as a parameter.

> ./fillit tetriminos_ex
